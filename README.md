# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy_1.ts --network testnet
```
Insert contract addresses and INIT_CODE_PAIR_HASH after run deploy_1.ts above to config.ts file

```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy_2.ts --network testnet
```
